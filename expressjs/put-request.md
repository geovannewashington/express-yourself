## What is the difference between PUT and POST?

PUT = replace a specific resource
It's used when you want to create or replace an known item.

## About the Array.prototype.find() method:

If the element found is a complex data type (like an object or an array).
It returns a reference, meaning that any changes you do will affect the orignal data structure in-place.

It returns undefined (a falsy value) when nothing was matched.
